# Kuckah
This project is a fun activity I worked on with my son during his school holiday. The name __"Kuckah"__ (pronounced _"Kooh-kah"_) comes from the name he gave to his soft monkey toy when he was three years old, and the name has stuck with us ever since.  

Itâ€™s a work-in-progress project that we will mainly update during school holidays and weekends.
