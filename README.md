# Kuckah
This project is a fun activity I worked on with my son during his school holiday. The name "Kuckah" (pronounced "Kooh-kah") comes from the name he gave to his soft monkey toy when he was three years old, and the name has stuck with us ever since.  Itâ€™s a work-in-progress project that we mainly update during school holidays and weekends
